Ultimately, my warnings were not heeded, costing investors $2.5 Billion

widely regarded that I played canary in the coal mine, despite the
unfortunate outcome.<br><br>
</tr><tr><td valign="top">

during an economic downturn.<br><br>
</tr><tr><td valign="top">
<b>Opened a<br>
new location</b>
</td><td>
Company was expanding, and needed a new store built, staffed, trained,

aggressively performing charitable service.<br><br>
</tr><tr><td valign="top">
<b>Helped start<br>
numerous companies</b>
</td><td>
Knowing I would be starting my own company in the future, I aided other
founders in the formation of their companies, to better acquaint myself with
the process. Starting a company is a unique experience, one few share.
Typically, either one is successful and never needs to start a company again
or one fails, never to return. However, as a business person I made the effort
to participate in many of these risky ventures to broaden this unique
knowledge base.<br><br>
</tr><tr><td valign="top">

<b>Compromised<br>
with the IRS</b>
</td><td>
Successfully made an offer in compromise, reducing a tax payer's burden
by $50,000 and extended the terms for 10 years. Similarly, forestalled
a lien on business assets against a $150,000 note due by quick, decisive
action. <br><br>
</tr><tr><td valign="top">
<b>Networked<br>
into a startup</b>
</td><td>
Startup businesses are tricky to discover. In this situation, I noted
a need for a new model within a particular industry. By networking with
people within that industry, I was provided knowledge and opportunity
for investing near the ground floor, yielding a 700% return over 6 months.
The startup went on to present in front of the European Commission.<br><br>
A similar startup, which I was not privy to invest in, but eagerly supported,
has gone on to generate $20 million of revenues within their first year,
while maintaining healthy profits. Most importantly however, financing
capital is still pouring in, and they will be expanding internationally
in year 2.<br><br>
</tr><tr><td valign="top">
